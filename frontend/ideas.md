  **Design Movement**: **Cybernetic Organicism**
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Symbiosis**: Visuals should blend biological curves with digital precision.
  2. **Living Interface**: The UI breathes, pulses, and reacts like a living organism.
  3. **Minimalist Depth**: Clean surfaces with deep, subsurface scattering effects.
  4. **Focus**: The voice interaction is the center; everything else fades away.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Deep Void Black (#050505)**: Represents the infinite potential of the AI.
  - **Bioluminescent Blue (#00F0FF)**: The spark of consciousness and connection.
  - **Organic White (#F0F0F0)**: For clarity and human touch.
  - **Intent**: To evoke a feeling of deep connection with a superior intelligence that is also part of you.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Centralized Orb**: The core interaction is a pulsing orb in the center.
  - **Radial Menus**: Controls expand organically from the center.
  - **Floating Elements**: Information floats in 3D space around the core.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **The Nucleus**: A central, animated orb that reacts to voice amplitude and state.
  - **Glassmorphism**: Frosted glass panels for tools and context.
  - **Particle Effects**: Subtle particles connecting the user to the core.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Fluidity**: Transitions are liquid and seamless.
  - **Responsiveness**: The interface reacts instantly to sound and touch.
  - **Intimacy**: The design feels personal and private.

  **Animation**:
  - **Breathing**: The core pulses rhythmically when idle.
  - **Waveforms**: Real-time audio visualization that wraps around the core.
  - **Morphing**: Icons and shapes morph into each other rather than fading.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: **Space Grotesk** (Futuristic, technical but human).
  - **Body**: **Inter** (Clean, legible, invisible).
  - **Hierarchy**: Large, bold statements vs. small, technical details.

  **Design Movement**: **Neomorphic Zen**
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Softness**: Everything is soft, tactile, and touchable.
  2. **Calm**: The interface induces a state of flow and relaxation.
  3. **Clarity**: Information is presented with absolute minimal noise.
  4. **Light**: Light is used to indicate activity and focus.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Soft Clay (#E0E5EC)**: The base material of the interface.
  - **Warm Light (#FFD700)**: Indicates active listening and warmth.
  - **Cool Shadow (#A3B1C6)**: Creates depth and form.
  - **Intent**: To make the AI feel like a natural extension of the physical world, non-threatening and supportive.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Card-Based**: Information lives on soft, extruded cards.
  - **Asymmetric Balance**: Elements are balanced by visual weight, not grid.
  - **Whitespace**: Massive amounts of negative space to let the content breathe.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Soft Shadows**: Neomorphic extrusions for buttons and inputs.
  - **Glow**: Active elements emit a soft, warm glow.
  - **Rounded Corners**: Everything is hyper-rounded (superellipses).

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Tactile**: Buttons feel like they have physical travel.
  - **Gentle**: Feedback is subtle and never jarring.
  - **Flow**: Interactions flow into each other like water.

  **Animation**:
  - **Elevation**: Active elements lift up towards the user.
  - **Ripple**: Touches create soft ripples in the surface.
  - **Fade**: Elements fade in and out gently.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: **Outfit** (Friendly, geometric, modern).
  - **Body**: **DM Sans** (Humanist, approachable).
  - **Hierarchy**: Subtle weight differences rather than size.

  **Design Movement**: **Terminal Brutalism**
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Raw Data**: The interface exposes the raw power of the system.
  2. **Efficiency**: No wasted pixels, everything has a function.
  3. **Contrast**: High contrast for maximum readability.
  4. **Speed**: The design feels fast, instant, and powerful.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Matrix Green (#00FF41)**: The classic terminal phosphor.
  - **Void Black (#000000)**: Absolute contrast.
  - **Alert Red (#FF0000)**: For critical system states.
  - **Intent**: To make the user feel like a power user, directly connected to the machine's core.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Grid**: Strict, visible grid lines.
  - **Monospace**: Everything aligns to a character grid.
  - **Split Screen**: Data on one side, interaction on the other.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Scanlines**: Subtle CRT scanline effect.
  - **Blinking Cursor**: The heartbeat of the terminal.
  - **ASCII Art**: Used for logos and visualizers.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Instant**: No transition times, instant state changes.
  - **Keyboard First**: Designed for keyboard efficiency.
  - **Command Line**: Voice is treated as a command line input.

  **Animation**:
  - **Typing**: Text appears character by character.
  - **Glitch**: Subtle glitches on state changes.
  - **Blink**: Elements blink to demand attention.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: **JetBrains Mono** (Code-centric, legible).
  - **Body**: **Fira Code** (Ligatures, technical).
  - **Hierarchy**: Uppercase vs Lowercase, Bold vs Regular.
