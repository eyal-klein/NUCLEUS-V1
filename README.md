# NUCLEUS V1.0

**A personalized, proactive AI system designed as a digital life partner.**

---

## Overview

NUCLEUS is not just another AI assistant. It is a **living, adaptive organism** that grows alongside you, understanding your unique DNA (values, goals, interests) and proactively creating opportunities for your continuous prosperity.

This repository contains the official architecture and implementation of NUCLEUS V1.0.

## Core Philosophy

NUCLEUS is built on three foundational principles, known as the **Three Super-Interests**:

1.  **Deepening (העמקה):** Continuously and deeply understand your unique DNA.
2.  **Expression (ביטוי):** Translate your DNA into tangible, value-creating actions in the world.
3.  **Quality of Life (איכות חיים):** Cultivate well-being, meaning, and continuous human development.

These three interests create a perpetual cycle called **"The Pulse"**, enabling the system to evolve infinitely as you grow.

## Architecture

NUCLEUS V1.0 is an **event-driven, multi-agent system** built on a modern Python stack, leveraging:

- **Google ADK (Agent Development Kit)** for agent management
- **LangChain** for tool definitions
- **PostgreSQL + pgvector** for data and semantic search
- **NATS JetStream** for event-driven communication
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** for deployment

For detailed architecture, see:

## Key Features

- **Biological Growth:** The system adapts and evolves as you grow, creating new agents and tools as needed.
- **Proactive Intelligence:** NUCLEUS doesn't wait for commands; it actively seeks opportunities to enhance your life.
- **Infinite Scalability:** There is no ceiling. As your interests expand, NUCLEUS expands with you.
- **Full Observability:** Every decision is logged and explainable.
